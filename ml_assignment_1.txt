1. What does one mean by the term &quot;machine learning&quot;?

Machine learning refers to a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and models that allow computer systems to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It involves the construction of mathematical models and algorithms that enable computers to analyze and interpret complex patterns and data, and subsequently make predictions or take actions based on that analysis.

Machine learning algorithms are designed to learn from data by identifying patterns, trends, and relationships within the input data. This learning process involves training the algorithm on a large dataset, where it learns to recognize and generalize from examples, and then using that trained model to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data.

There are different types of machine learning approaches, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled examples, where the desired output is known for each input. Unsupervised learning involves finding patterns and structures in unlabeled data. Reinforcement learning focuses on training agents to make sequential decisions in an environment, learning from rewards or punishments.

Machine learning has a wide range of applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, fraud detection, recommendation systems, autonomous vehicles, and many more. It plays a crucial role in extracting meaningful insights and making accurate predictions from vast amounts of data, driving advancements in various fields and industries.
