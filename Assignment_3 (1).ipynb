    "In object-oriented programming, an abstract superclass is a class that is designed to be inherited by other classes, but is not intended to be instantiated on its own. The purpose of an abstract superclass is to define common properties and behavior that are shared by its subclasses, which can then extend or modify this behavior as necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An abstract superclass is declared as abstract, meaning that it cannot be instantiated directly. It may contain abstract methods, which are declared but not implemented in the superclass. Subclasses of the abstract superclass are required to provide an implementation for these abstract methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By defining common behavior in an abstract superclass, you can avoid duplication of code across multiple subclasses, and make it easier to maintain and update your codebase. Additionally, by using an abstract superclass, you can ensure that the code adheres to a certain set of rules or constraints that are defined by the superclass."
