# Q1. What are the two latest user-defined exception constraints in Python 3.X?
1. __cause__: This constraint allows a programmer to associate an exception with another exception that caused it. It's used to create a chain of exceptions, where one exception is caused by another. This can be useful in debugging and error reporting, as it provides more information about the source of the error.

2. __context__: This constraint allows a programmer to associate an exception with the context in which it occurred. It's used to create a context for an exception, which can be useful for providing additional information about the error. The context is typically the location in the code where the exception was raised, and it can help a programmer understand the sequence of events that led to the error.

Both of these constraints can be useful for creating more informative and meaningful error messages, which can help a programmer debug and fix errors more easily. They are also useful for propagating exceptions up the call stack, so that they can be handled appropriately at a higher level of the program.
# Q2. How are class-based exceptions that have been raised matched to handlers?

In Python, class-based exceptions that have been raised are matched to handlers using the "try/except" statement. When an exception is raised, Python checks the "except" clauses in the surrounding "try" statement in the order in which they appear. If a matching exception handler is found, the code in that handler is executed, and the program continues running after the "except" block.


```python
class MyException(Exception):
    pass

try:
    raise MyException("An error occurred")
except MyException as e:
    print("MyException was raised:", e)

```

    MyException was raised: An error occurred
    

In this example, a custom exception class "MyException" is defined, and then raised with an error message using the "raise" statement. The "try/except" statement then catches the exception and prints an error message.

When Python encounters the "except" clause, it checks whether the raised exception is an instance of the specified exception class. If it is, the code in the "except" block is executed. If not, Python continues checking the other "except" clauses in the surrounding "try" statement.

It's important to note that if an exception is not caught by any of the "except" clauses, the program will terminate and print a traceback of the exception. Therefore, it's recommended to include a catch-all "except" block at the end of the "try" statement to handle any unexpected exceptions.

Overall, class-based exceptions in Python provide a powerful way to handle errors and exceptional conditions in a program, and the "try/except" statement allows a programmer to handle specific exceptions in a flexible and customizable way.


# Q3. Describe two methods for attaching context information to exception artefacts.

Attaching context information to exception artifacts can be useful in providing more information about the error or exception that occurred. Here are two methods for attaching context information:

1. Using the "with_traceback()" method: This method can be used to attach a traceback object to an exception. A traceback object contains information about the call stack, including the line numbers and file names where the code was executed. By attaching a traceback object to an exception, a programmer can provide more detailed information about the location and sequence of events that led to the error. Here's an example:


```python
try:
    # code that may raise an exception
except Exception as e:
    tb = sys.exc_info()[2]
    new_exception = MyException("An error occurred")
    new_exception.__cause__ = e
    new_exception = new_exception.with_traceback(tb)
    raise new_exception

```

In this example, a new exception object is created and attached to the original exception object using the "cause" attribute. A traceback object is then obtained using the "sys.exc_info()" function, and attached to the new exception object using the "with_traceback()" method. Finally, the new exception object is raised.

2. Using the "args" attribute: This attribute can be used to attach additional information to an exception by including it in the arguments passed to the exception constructor. By convention, the first argument to an exception constructor is a string that describes the error or exception. Additional context information can be included as subsequent arguments. Here's an example:


```python
class MyException(Exception):
    def __init__(self, message, context):
        self.context = context
        super().__init__(message)

try:
    # code that may raise an exception
except Exception as e:
    raise MyException("An error occurred", context="additional context information") from e

```

In this example, a custom exception class "MyException" is defined, which takes two arguments: a message and a context. The context is stored as an attribute of the exception object. When an exception is raised, the context information is included as an argument to the exception constructor using the "from" keyword. This creates a new exception object that includes the context information, and associates it with the original exception object using the "cause" attribute.

Overall, attaching context information to exception artifacts can be useful in providing more detailed information about errors and exceptions, which can help in debugging and error handling. The two methods described above provide flexible and customizable ways to attach context information to exceptions in Python.

# Q4. Describe two methods for specifying the text of an exception object&#39;s error message.
In Python, there are several methods for specifying the text of an exception object's error message, but two common methods are:

1. Using the __init__ method:
In this method, a custom exception class is defined by subclassing an existing exception class (e.g., Exception), and the __init__ method is defined with the desired error message as a parameter. The error message can be provided as a string literal or formatted string, and can include any relevant information such as variable values or contextual information.

```python
class MyCustomException(Exception):
    def __init__(self, var1, var2):
        self.message = f"An error occurred with var1={var1} and var2={var2}"

```

This creates a new exception class called MyCustomException that includes the values of var1 and var2 in the error message.

2. Using the raise statement:
In this method, an exception is raised using a pre-defined exception class (e.g., ValueError) and the desired error message is passed as an argument. The error message can also be a string literal or formatted string, and can include any relevant information. Here's an example:


```python
var = 10
if var > 5:
    raise ValueError(f"var={var} is too large")

```


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)

    Input In [5], in <cell line: 2>()
          1 var = 10
          2 if var > 5:
    ----> 3     raise ValueError(f"var={var} is too large")
    

    ValueError: var=10 is too large


This raises a ValueError exception with the error message "var=10 is too large" if var is greater than 5.

By using either of these methods, programmers can provide more informative and helpful error messages that aid in debugging and troubleshooting their code.

# Q5. Why do you no longer use string-based exceptions?

String-based exceptions have been deprecated and are no longer used in modern programming languages because they lack the flexibility, expressiveness, and maintainability of exception classes.

String-based exceptions provide a single, static error message that doesn't allow for additional information or customization based on the specific circumstances of the exception. This makes it difficult to diagnose and troubleshoot errors, and can lead to less informative and less helpful error messages. In addition, string-based exceptions are harder to organize and manage than exception classes, making it more difficult to maintain and update code over time.

By contrast, exception classes provide a more structured and organized approach to handling errors. Exception classes can be customized with specific error messages, additional information, and custom logic for handling specific types of exceptions. This allows for more informative and helpful error messages, better debugging, and easier maintenance of code over time. As a result, exception classes are the preferred approach for handling exceptions in modern programming languages.
